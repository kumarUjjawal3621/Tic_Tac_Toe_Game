A simple Tic Tac Toe game that is played entirely through the command line interface.
It has 3 features: 
  Player vs Player
  Player vs computer  
  Player vs computer (where the algorithm is such that computer never loose the game)
Rest instructions to play the game will appear on the terminal.

PS: I created this app in my Introduction to programming course, and haven't updated yet. Hence it needs a lot of improvement.
